# Activating debug mode in the American Truck Simulator

* American Truck Simulator by defualt offers a native way to enable console and
developer mode. All you need to do is head over to your Documents/American Truck Simulator path and open config.cfg file using notepad or any other tool. Once you got that opened, go ahead and start looking for `g_developer` and `g_console`. Next to the naem you should find a quoted number that repesents the status. Zero means that it is currently and off and as you might've guessed - one means it is on. Make sure that both of these variables have "1" quoted next to them or else you would not be able to use the developer mode.

# Native plugins & telemetry data

SCS software offers a SDK for both American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator. The data between these two games is the same (breaking intenstity, current job offers and stuff) in theory. I'll put up some major differences if I ever come across any of them.
The repository holds 'ets2-client' and 'ets2-telementry' folder which include /gets/ for variables. That means that you're only able to fetch the /live/ data but not change it using the functions inside the SDK. 

-- to be worked on.
